  <div class="def">
    <h2 class="conduction_all_subtopics">📘 Definition</h2>
    <p>Thermal conductivity (<code>k</code>) is a physical property that describes how efficiently a material can conduct heat. It is defined as the amount of heat that passes in unit time through a unit area of a material with a temperature gradient of one degree per unit distance.</p>
    <p><strong>SI Unit:</strong> W/m·K (watts per meter per Kelvin)</p>
  </div>

  <div class="def">
    <h2 class="conduction_all_subtopics">📐 Mathematical Expression</h2>
    <p>The basic formula for thermal conduction is:</p>
    <p><code>q = -k · A · (dT/dx)</code></p>
    <ul class="future_tch_points">
      <li><strong>q:</strong> Heat transfer rate (W)</li>
      <li><strong>k:</strong> Thermal conductivity (W/m·K)</li>
      <li><strong>A:</strong> Cross-sectional area (m²)</li>
      <li><strong>dT/dx:</strong> Temperature gradient (K/m)</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="def">
    <h2 class="conduction_all_subtopics">➖ Negative Sign and Physical Interpretation</h2>
    <p>The **negative sign** in the heat conduction equation, <code>q = -k · A · (dT/dx)</code>, plays a crucial role in determining the **direction of heat flow**. Here's a detailed explanation:</p>

    <h3>1. Direction of Heat Flow</h3>
    <p>Heat always flows from regions of **high temperature** to **low temperature**. The negative sign ensures that heat flux is always directed towards the cooler region, which is a direct application of the second law of thermodynamics.</p>
    <ul class="future_tch_points">
      <li>If the temperature increases in the direction of heat flow (**dT/dx > 0**), the **negative sign** ensures the heat flows toward the cooler region (from hot to cold).</li>
      <li>If the temperature decreases in the direction of heat flow (**dT/dx < 0**), the **negative sign** ensures the heat still flows from the hotter region towards the cooler region.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Physical Interpretation in Terms of Thermodynamics</h3>
    <p>The negative sign reflects the **second law of thermodynamics**, which states that heat flows naturally from areas of higher thermal energy (hot) to areas of lower thermal energy (cold). This principle is fundamental in all heat transfer processes.</p>
    <p>The **negative sign** ensures that the direction of heat flow follows this natural process, in line with thermodynamic laws.</p>

    <h3>3. Mathematical Perspective</h3>
    <p>Mathematically, **dT/dx** represents the rate of temperature change over a given distance. The **negative sign** indicates that heat always flows in the direction opposite to the temperature gradient, meaning heat flows from **hot to cold**.</p>
    <ul class="future_tch_points">
      <li>If **dT/dx > 0** (temperature increases along x), the negative sign ensures heat flows toward the cooler region (negative x direction).</li>
      <li>If **dT/dx < 0** (temperature decreases along x), the negative sign ensures heat flows in the positive x direction (again, from hot to cold).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This confirms that heat flows from the hot side to the cold side, maintaining the correct directionality in the equation.</p>
