  <h1 class="conduction_heading">🔥 Variable Thermal Conductivity in Transient Heat Conduction</h1>

  <div class="def">
    <h2 class="conduction_all_subtopics">📘 Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      In many real-world applications, the thermal conductivity \(k\) of materials changes with temperature.
      This temperature dependence leads to non-linear behavior in the heat conduction equation,
      especially in transient (time-varying) scenarios. For example, during rapid heating, as in fire exposure or high-power electronics,
      the ability of materials to conduct heat changes significantly, influencing temperature distribution.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="def">
    <h2 class="conduction_all_subtopics">📐 Governing Equation</h2>
    <p>The 1D transient heat conduction equation becomes non-linear when \( k \) varies with temperature:</p>
    <div class="formula-box">
      \[
      \rho c_p \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( k(T) \frac{\partial T}{\partial x} \right)
      \]
    </div>
    <p>
      This form accounts for the variation of conductivity inside the differential operator.
      It cannot be simplified using constant-coefficient solutions and must be approached numerically.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="def">
    <h2 class="conduction_all_subtopics">🔢 Common Models for \(k(T)\)</h2>
    <ul class="future_tch_points">
      <li>Linear: \( k(T) = k_0 (1 + \beta T) \)</li>
      <li>Exponential: \( k(T) = k_0 e^{\alpha T} \)</li>
      <li>Power Law: \( k(T) = aT^n \)</li>
      <li>Empirical polynomial fit: \( k(T) = a + bT + cT^2 \)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These models are selected based on experimental data or theoretical analysis. For moderate temperature ranges,
      linear or polynomial forms are generally used.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="def">
    <h2 class="conduction_all_subtopics">🧮 Derivation Insight</h2>
    <p>
      To derive a numerical form, we discretize the spatial domain using central differencing and time using finite differences.
      The diffusion term becomes:
    </p>
    <div class="formula-box">
      \[
      \left( k \frac{\partial T}{\partial x} \right) \approx \frac{1}{\Delta x} \left[ k_{i+1/2} \frac{T_{i+1} - T_i}{\Delta x} - k_{i-1/2} \frac{T_i - T_{i-1}}{\Delta x} \right]
      \]
    </div>
    <p>
      Where \( k_{i+1/2} \) and \( k_{i-1/2} \) are evaluated using interpolated values of \( k(T) \) between adjacent nodes.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="def">
    <h2 class="conduction_all_subtopics">🧪 Practical Engineering Applications</h2>
    <ul class="future_tch_points">
      <li>🚀 Spacecraft re-entry insulation undergoing extreme heating</li>
      <li>🔥 Thermal barrier coatings in jet engines and turbines</li>
      <li>🔋 Battery thermal runaway and safety modeling</li>
      <li>💡 High-intensity LEDs and microprocessors under fluctuating loads</li>
      <li>🏗️ Fire-resistance testing in structural components</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These systems operate in wide temperature ranges where assuming constant thermal conductivity leads to
      inaccurate predictions of hot spots and failure points.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="def">
    <h2 class="conduction_all_subtopics">⚙️ Numerical Solution Tips</h2>
    <ul class="future_tch_points">
      <li>Use iterative methods like Newton-Raphson for nonlinear systems</li>
      <li>Apply implicit time-stepping (e.g., Crank-Nicolson) for stability</li>
      <li>Update thermal conductivity at each iteration based on temperature</li>
      <li>Use relaxation or under-relaxation to prevent divergence</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Tools such as MATLAB, Python (NumPy + SciPy), and COMSOL can simulate such systems effectively.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="def">
    <h2 class="conduction_all_subtopics">🔁 Physical Interpretation</h2>
    <p>
      As the material heats up, the structure of its molecules may allow easier or harder flow of heat.
      In metals, \(k\) usually decreases with temperature due to electron scattering, while in insulators,
      \(k\) might increase. This changing behavior alters how fast and how far heat can propagate over time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, accounting for variable \(k(T)\) is essential when dealing with wide temperature ranges,
      especially in thermal runaway and fire safety assessments.
