      <h3 class="conduction_all_subtopics">What is the Mechanism of Heat Conduction?</h3>
      <p>Heat conduction in solids happens mainly due to the following two mechanisms:</p>
      <ul class="future_tch_points">
        <li><strong>1. Lattice Vibration:</strong> When a solid is heated, the particles vibrate more intensely. These vibrations are passed from one atom to the next, transferring heat through the solid. This is the main mode of heat transfer in non-metals.</li>
        <li><strong>2. Free Electron Movement (in Metals):</strong> In materials like metals, free electrons gain kinetic energy when heated. These electrons move freely, transferring thermal energy across the material. This is why metals are excellent conductors of heat.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The combined effect of these two mechanisms leads to the efficient transfer of heat across the solid material, even without any bulk movement of the substance itself.</p>

      <h3 class="conduction_all_subtopics">Detailed Mechanisms</h3>
      <p>When a solid is heated at one end, the atoms in that region vibrate more vigorously. The energy from these vibrating atoms is passed along to neighboring atoms through collisions, transferring heat across the material.</p>
      <p>In metals, the role of free electrons is crucial. These electrons move much faster than the atoms and can transfer thermal energy from the hot region to the cooler region of the solid quickly. This is why metals have high thermal conductivity compared to non-metals.</p>

      <h3 class="conduction_all_subtopics">Key Features of Heat Conduction in Solids</h3>
      <ul class="future_tch_points">
        <li>🔥 Heat transfers from higher to lower temperature regions via atomic vibrations.</li>
        <li>⚡ In metals, free electrons play a major role in heat conduction.</li>
        <li>📐 The rate of heat conduction is determined by material properties, temperature gradient, and cross-sectional area.</li>
        <li>💡 The efficiency of heat conduction depends on the material's thermal conductivity.</li>
        <li>🏗️ Insulating materials like wood or plastics have low thermal conductivity and resist heat flow.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="conduction_all_subtopics">Conduction in Different Materials</h3>
      <p>Heat conduction can vary greatly depending on the type of material:</p>
      <ul class="future_tch_points">
        <li><strong>Metals:</strong> Metals like copper, aluminum, and silver are excellent conductors of heat because of their free electrons.</li>
        <li><strong>Non-Metals:</strong> Materials like wood, rubber, and glass are poor conductors of heat and are used as insulators.</li>
        <li><strong>Gases:</strong> Heat conduction in gases is much less efficient than in solids, as the molecules are farther apart.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="conduction_all_subtopics">Example of Heat Conduction Mechanism</h3>
      <p>When a metal rod is heated at one end, the particles at the hot end start vibrating. These vibrations are transferred to neighboring particles, and gradually, the heat travels through the entire rod. In metals, the free electrons assist in quickly spreading the thermal energy.</p>
