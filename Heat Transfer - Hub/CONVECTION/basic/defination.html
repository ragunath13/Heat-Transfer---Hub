    <h2>Definition</h2>
    <p>Convection is the mode of heat transfer that occurs in fluids (liquids or gases) due to the combined effect of fluid motion and temperature differences.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="fatc">Physical Meaning</div>
  <div class="indus_">
    <p>When a fluid comes into contact with a hot surface, the fluid particles near the surface gain energy, become lighter, and rise. Cooler particles take their place, forming a continuous circulation. This movement of the fluid helps carry heat from one region to another.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="convection-box">
    <h2>Simple Animation of Convection</h2>
    <p>Imagine air above a hot surface. The warm air rises and cooler air replaces it, creating a flow. This is how convection works!</p>
    <div class="airflow"></div>
    <div class="simple-diagram">

    Types of Convection
  </div>
  <ul class="future_tch_points">
    <li><strong>Natural Convection:</strong> Occurs naturally due to density differences caused by temperature variations.</li>
    <li><strong>Forced Convection:</strong> Occurs when fluid motion is caused by external means like a fan or pump.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="conduction_all_subtopics">
    Real-Life Applications
  </div>
  <ul class="future_tch_points">
    <li>Boiling water on a stove (natural convection)</li>
    <li>Air conditioning systems (forced convection)</li>
    <li>Cooling of electronic devices</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="indus_">
    <p>
      Convection occurs when thermal energy is transferred through the actual movement of fluid particles. When a fluid (like air or water) is heated, the molecules near the heat source gain kinetic energy, causing them to move faster and spread apart. This lowers their density and makes them rise.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the hot, less dense fluid rises, the surrounding cooler, denser fluid moves in to take its place. This sets up a circulation pattern known as a <strong>convection current</strong>. This process continues as long as there's a temperature difference in the fluid.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, imagine a room being heated by a radiator. The air near the radiator warms up, rises toward the ceiling, and cooler air flows in to replace it near the floor. Over time, this creates a loop that circulates warm air throughout the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another everyday example is boiling water: water at the bottom of the pot gets heated first, rises to the top, and cooler water descends to be heated again. This is why boiling water moves in a swirling pattern — a direct visual of convection!
    </p>
    <p>
      Convection is not just a domestic phenomenon — it's a vital mechanism in Earth's weather systems, ocean currents, and even in stars. It plays a key role in distributing energy and maintaining balance in natural and engineered systems.

    <h2>Basic Formula for Convective Heat Transfer</h2>
    <code>Q = h · A · (T<sub>surface</sub> - T<sub>fluid</sub>)</code>
    <p>Where:<br>
      <strong>Q</strong> = heat transfer rate<br>
      <strong>h</strong> = convective heat transfer coefficient<br>
      <strong>A</strong> = surface area<br>
      <strong>T<sub>surface</sub></strong> = temperature of the surface<br>
      <strong>T<sub>fluid</sub></strong> = temperature of the fluid
