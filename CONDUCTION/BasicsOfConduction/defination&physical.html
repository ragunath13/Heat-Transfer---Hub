        <h3 class="conduction_all_subtopics">What is Conduction?</h3>
        <p>Conduction is the process by which heat flows through a solid material without the bulk movement of the material itself. Heat moves from the hotter part of the object to the cooler part, particle by particle, like a quiet chain reaction of energy.</p>
        <p><strong>Definition by Holman (1981):</strong> "Heat conduction is the transfer of energy from the more energetic particles to the adjacent less energetic ones due to interaction between particles."
        </p>
        <p><strong>Definition by Yunus A. Çengel:</strong> "Conduction is the transfer of energy from the more energetic particles of a substance to the adjacent less energetic ones as a result of interaction between particles."
        </p>
        <p><strong>Definition by Incropera & DeWitt:</strong> "Conduction is the energy transfer across a system boundary due to a temperature gradient in the absence of bulk motion."

        <h3 class="conduction_all_subtopics">Physical Meaning</h3>
        <p>When heat is applied to a solid, the particles in the hotter region vibrate more vigorously. These vibrations collide with neighboring particles, transferring thermal energy through the material. The substance stays in place—but the heat keeps moving forward.</p>

        <h3 class="conduction_all_subtopics">Key Characteristics</h3>
        <ul class="future_tch_points">
          <li>🧱 Occurs mainly in solids, especially metals due to their free electrons.</li>
          <li>🔗 Requires physical contact between regions of different temperatures.</li>
          <li>🌀 No flow of material, only energy is transferred.</li>
          <li>⚡ Metals conduct best because of free electrons that carry energy quickly.</li>
          <li>🧊 Poor conductors, like wood or plastic, are called insulators.</li>
          <li>📏 Rate of conduction depends on material type, thickness, and temperature gradient.</li>
          <li>🧮 Described by Fourier’s Law of heat conduction:<br>
            <code>q = -k · dT/dx</code></li>
